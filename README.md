# Platform.sh CLI

The **Platform.sh CLI** is the official command-line interface for [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh). Use this tool to interact with your [Platform.sh](https://platform.sh) projects, and to build them locally for development purposes.

This repository hosts the source code and releases of the new CLI.

> This product includes PHP software, freely available from [the PHP website](https://www.php.net/software)

## Install

To install the CLI, use either [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/) (on Linux, macOS, or the Windows Subsystem for Linux) or [Scoop](https://scoop.sh/) (on Windows):

### HomeBrew

```console
brew install platformsh/tap/platformsh-cli
```

> If you have issues with missing libraries on a Mac, see how to [troubleshoot CLI installation on M1/M2 Macs](https://community.platform.sh/t/troubleshoot-cli-installation-on-m1-macs/1202).

### Scoop

```console
scoop bucket add platformsh https://github.com/platformsh/homebrew-tap.git
scoop install platform
```

### Bash installer

Use the bash installer for an automated installation, using the most preferable way for your system.

```console
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/platformsh/cli/main/installer.sh | bash
```

The installer is configurable using the following environment variables:

* `INSTALL_LOG` - the install log file
* `INSTALL_METHOD` - force a specific installation method, possible values are `brew` and `raw`
* `INSTALL_DIR` - the installation directory for the `raw` installation method, for example you can use `INSTALL_DIR=$HOME/.local/bin` for a single user installation
* `VERSION` - the version of the CLI to install, if you need a version other than the latest one


### Nix profile

Refer to the [Nix
documentation if you are not on NixOS](https://nix.dev/manual/nix/2.24/installation/installing-binary.html).

```console
nix profile install nixpkgs#platformsh
nix profile install nixpkgs#upsun
```

## Under the hood

The New Platform.sh CLI is built with backwards compatibility in mind. This is why we've embedded PHP, so that all Legacy PHP CLI commands can be executed in the exact same way, making sure that nothing breaks when you switch to it.

## Building binaries, snapshots and releases

Build a single binary

```console
# Build a single binary for Platform.sh
make single
# Build a single binary for Upsun
make single GORELEASER_ID=upsun
```

Build a snapshot

```console
# Build and snapshot for Platform.sh and Upsun
make snapshot
# Build a snapshot for a vendor
# Download the config file at internal/config/embedded-config.yaml
make vendor-snapshot VENDOR_NAME='Upsun staging' VENDOR_BINARY='upsunstg'
```

Create a release

```console
# First, create a new tag, if not already on a Git tag
git tag -f -m 'Release v5.0.0' '5.0.0'

# Create a release for Platform.sh and Upsun
# Expose a GITHUB_TOKEN to use for the release
make release

# Create a release for a vendor with the default .gorelease.vendor.yaml.tpl
# Download the config file at internal/config/embedded-config.yaml
# Optionally, download the .goreleaser.vendor.yaml file to use a custom one
make vendor-release VENDOR_NAME='Upsun staging' VENDOR_BINARY='upsunstg'
```

## Licenses

This binary redistributes PHP in a binary form, which comes with the [PHP License](https://www.php.net/license/3_01.txt).
